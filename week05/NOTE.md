#### Realm

```
Before it is evaluated, all ECMAScript code must be associated with a realm. Conceptually, a realm consists of a set of
intrinsic objects, an ECMAScript global environment, all of the ECMAScript code that is loaded within the scope of that
global environment, and other associated state and resources.
